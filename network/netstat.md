The `netstat` command in Linux is a versatile networking tool that provides information and statistics about the system's networking stack. It is used to print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.

Here are some key features and options of the `netstat` command:

### Common Options:

1. **`-a`**: Displays all active connections and listening ports.
2. **`-t`**: Shows TCP connections.
3. **`-u`**: Shows UDP connections.
4. **`-n`**: Displays addresses and port numbers in numerical form, rather than resolving hostnames.
5. **`-l`**: Lists only listening sockets.
6. **`-p`**: Shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.
7. **`-r`**: Displays the kernel routing table.
8. **`-i`**: Displays a table of all network interfaces.
9. **`-s`**: Provides summary statistics for each protocol.
10. **`-c`**: Continuously displays the selected information, refreshing every second.

### Example Usage:

1. **Show all connections and listening ports:**
   ```bash
   netstat -a
   ```

2. **Show all TCP connections:**
   ```bash
   netstat -t
   ```

3. **Show all UDP connections:**
   ```bash
   netstat -u
   ```

4. **Show numeric addresses instead of resolving hostnames:**
   ```bash
   netstat -n
   ```

5. **Show all listening ports:**
   ```bash
   netstat -l
   ```

6. **Show connections along with the program PID and name:**
   ```bash
   netstat -p
   ```

7. **Show the kernel routing table:**
   ```bash
   netstat -r
   ```

8. **Show network interfaces:**
   ```bash
   netstat -i
   ```

9. **Show summary statistics for each protocol:**
   ```bash
   netstat -s
   ```

10. **Continuously update the display every second:**
    ```bash
    netstat -c
    ```

### Replacement and Alternatives:

While `netstat` is still widely used, it has been deprecated in favor of newer tools such as `ss`, `ip`, and `iproute2` commands, which provide more detailed and flexible network information.

1. **`ss` (Socket Statistics):**
   ```bash
   ss -tuln
   ```

2. **`ip` (part of the `iproute2` suite):**
   ```bash
   ip addr show
   ip route show
   ```

### Example Comparisons:

- **Listing all TCP connections using `ss`:**
  ```bash
  ss -t
  ```

- **Listing all UDP connections using `ss`:**
  ```bash
  ss -u
  ```

By understanding the `netstat` command and its alternatives, you can efficiently monitor and manage network connections on your Linux system.
