Finding out which package manager installed a particular application can be done using various methods, depending on the operating system and package managers in use. Here are some methods for popular Linux distributions:

### 1. **Debian-Based Systems (e.g., Ubuntu):**

#### Using `dpkg`:
The `dpkg` tool is the low-level package manager for Debian-based systems. You can use `dpkg -S` (or `dpkg --search`) to find which package a file belongs to.

```bash
dpkg -S $(which application)
```
Example:
```bash
dpkg -S $(which nginx)
```

#### Using `apt`:
You can also use `apt` to list information about a package:

```bash
apt list --installed | grep application
```
Example:
```bash
apt list --installed | grep nginx
```

### 2. **Red Hat-Based Systems (e.g., CentOS, Fedora):**

#### Using `rpm`:
The `rpm` command is the low-level package manager for Red Hat-based systems. You can use `rpm -qf` (or `rpm --query --file`) to find which package a file belongs to.

```bash
rpm -qf $(which application)
```
Example:
```bash
rpm -qf $(which httpd)
```

#### Using `yum` (for CentOS 7 and earlier) or `dnf` (for Fedora and CentOS 8+):
You can list installed packages and grep for the application name:

```bash
yum list installed | grep application
# or
dnf list installed | grep application
```
Example:
```bash
dnf list installed | grep httpd
```

### 3. **Arch-Based Systems:**

#### Using `pacman`:
The `pacman` package manager can be used to query the database for installed packages.

```bash
pacman -Qo $(which application)
```
Example:
```bash
pacman -Qo $(which pacman)
```

### 4. **Generic Method for Any System:**

#### Using `which` and `file`:
You can use `which` to find the path of the executable and `file` to determine its type. Then, check the package manager logs or metadata.

1. Find the path of the executable:

```bash
which application
```
Example:
```bash
which nginx
```

2. Determine the file type and possible installation method:

```bash
file $(which application)
```
Example:
```bash
file $(which nginx)
```

3. Check package manager logs (optional):
   - Debian-based systems might log package installations in `/var/log/dpkg.log`.
   - Red Hat-based systems might log package installations in `/var/log/yum.log` or `/var/log/dnf.log`.

### 5. **Using `whereis` (for general information):**

The `whereis` command locates the binary, source, and manual page files for a command.

```bash
whereis application
```
Example:
```bash
whereis nginx
```

### Summary

- **Debian-based systems**: Use `dpkg -S` or `apt list --installed`.
- **Red Hat-based systems**: Use `rpm -qf`, `yum list installed`, or `dnf list installed`.
- **Arch-based systems**: Use `pacman -Qo`.
- **Generic method**: Use `which` and `file`, and check package manager logs.
- **For additional information**: Use `whereis`.

These methods help identify the package manager and package that installed a particular application on various Linux distributions.
